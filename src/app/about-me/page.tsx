        I started as an apprentice in 2022 where I participated in a 13 week

            I have had the pleasure of mentoring Nathan over the past few years,
            and I am consistently impressed by his progress and dedication.
            Starting as an apprentice, Nathan has developed into a highly
            capable software developer with a broad skill set that allows him to
            tackle most web-based development work with confidence. Nathan is
            particularly strong in frontend development, where his attention to
            detail and user-centric approach shine. However, he is also
            proficient across the full stack, making him a versatile and
            valuable team member. He regularly contributes innovative ideas to
            the design of applications, demonstrating a keen understanding of
            both the technical and user-experience aspects of development. In
            addition to his technical abilities, Nathan is an excellent team
            player. He collaborates effectively with colleagues, communicates
            clearly, and is always willing to assist others when needed. His
            positive attitude and willingness to learn make him a pleasure to
            work with. I have no doubt that Nathan will be a valuable asset to
            any team he joins. He has a bright future ahead of him, and I
            wholeheartedly recommend him.
